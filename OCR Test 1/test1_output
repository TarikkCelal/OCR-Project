On Easter morning in the year 1944, I took my six-year-old
son by the hand and began walking fron my home town toward the
valleys and forests of the Carpathian mountains. For nearly
eight months we lived in barns, attics and makeshift cabins. With
the generous nelp of an unusually courageous man, we managed to
survive Europe's greatest fit of madness. Those who walked in
the opposite direction on that Easter day were lese fortunate.
They were taken in trainloads to places whose once obscure names
are now, and forever will be, synonymous with terror, evil and
death. What follows is our story of survival told to the best
of my ability, in plain, simple language.

In March of 1944 the SS troops took over the internal affairs
of Hungary and proceeded to organize the deportation of the Jews.
To the Nazie thie was a routine assignment; within hourg all local :
officials were informed of operational plans. The high comand
issued a directive designed to placate Jewish feara and induce
cooperation. It was announced that the Jewa would be shipped to
Poland as an emergency labor force and that they were only being
drafted for temporary work. There were many who believed this ,
version. Others, less credulous, resigred themselves and hoped for
the vest. Still others began to make plans for escape. By Aprii
13 the Hungarian Jews were being rounded up from all over the .
country in what was once a huge brick factory. The rest ie well

known.

J was working in Ungvar and usually came home on weokents.

At that time it was no longer possible for a Jew to travel freely.
